# Progress – Chord Web App Frontend

## Status Overview
- Phase: MVP build
- Overall health: In progress

## Completed Work (update continuously)
- [ ] Setup React + TypeScript project
- [ ] Choose and configure router (React Router or Next.js routing)
- [ ] Set up base layout (header, content, footer)
- [ ] Implement login & register UI
- [ ] Integrate auth with backend (login, profile fetch)
- [ ] Implement songs list page with backend integration
- [ ] Implement song detail page with chords display
- [ ] Implement favorites page and actions
- [ ] Add basic responsive design
- [ ] Add basic tests for critical flows

## Known Issues / Risks
- [ ] Decide final auth handling strategy (cookies vs localStorage)
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling for network/API failures
- [ ] Optimize rendering of long content (lyrics with chords)
