# Progress – Chord Web App Frontend

## Status Overview
- Phase: MVP build
- Overall health: In progress; songs CRUD functional, auth/favorites pending.

## Completed Work
- [x] Setup React + TypeScript project
- [x] Configure React Router routing
- [x] Base layout (header, content, footer)
- [ ] Login & register UI
- [ ] Auth integration (login/profile)
- [x] Songs list page (backend integration, search)
- [x] Song detail page with inline chord display ([chord])
- [x] Create song page (inline chords, tags, publish toggle)
- [x] Edit song page with save + delete
- [x] Delete song action with confirmation
- [x] Button variants (primary/secondary/danger) and dark panels
- [ ] Favorites page/actions
- [ ] Basic responsive design
- [ ] Basic tests for critical flows

## Known Issues / Risks
- [ ] Decide auth handling (cookies vs localStorage)
- [ ] Add toasts/modals for better UX; current delete uses confirm
- [ ] Optimize rendering of long chord sheets; add skeletons/empty states

## Progress Log
- 2025-12-09 – Songs CRUD hooked to backend; inline chord format adopted; edit/delete added; UI buttons themed.
