# Product Context – Chord Web App Frontend

## Why This Frontend Exists
The backend exposes a clean API for chords and songs.
The frontend provides:
- A nice, discoverable UI for guitar players and worship teams
- A better experience than random chord websites

## Target Users
- Guitar players practicing at home
- Worship leaders / band members
- Music learners searching for chords online

## Core Use Cases (MVP)
1. As a user, I can open the site and immediately see a list of songs or a search bar.
2. As a user, I can search by song title, artist, tag, or key.
3. As a user, I can click a song and view its chords/lyrics in a readable layout.
4. As a logged-in user, I can favorite/unfavorite songs and view my favorites list.

## UX Principles
- Minimalist, content-first design
- Clear hierarchy: Song list → Song detail → Favorites
- Fast search feedback (loading states, no blocking UI)
- Good readability for chords (fonts, line height, spacing)
- Fully responsive: works well on both desktop and mobile browsers
