# Project Brief – Chord Web App Frontend (React)

## Project Name
Chord Web App – Frontend (React)

## Vision
Provide a clean, fast, and focused web experience for viewing and managing chord sheets for songs.

Users should be able to:
- Browse and search songs with chords
- Open a song and read chords + lyrics comfortably
- Log in to access their favorites
- Save and manage favorite songs

## Primary Goals (MVP)
- Connect to the existing NestJS + MongoDB backend API
- Implement core pages:
  - Auth (login/register)
  - Song list (search + filters)
  - Song detail (chord view)
  - Favorites
- Provide a responsive UI that works on desktop and mobile browsers
- Keep frontend architecture simple but scalable

## Non-Goals (Not in MVP)
- Complex admin dashboard
- In-browser chord editor
- Realtime collaboration
- Offline-first PWA with complex caching

## Success Criteria
- A user can log in, search songs, view chords, and manage favorites without errors.
- The frontend talks reliably to the backend using the defined API.
- Codebase is organized and easy to extend (e.g., tags management, chord transposition UI later).
