# Active Context – Chord Web App Frontend

## Current Phase
- Initial MVP implementation for the React frontend.

## Current Focus Area
- Setting up the React project and base architecture.
- Implementing auth flow and basic navigation.

## Recently Completed (example, update as you go)
- [ ] React project created (with TypeScript)
- [ ] Routing set up (React Router or Next.js pages)

- [ ] API client helper (base URL, auth token handling)
- [ ] Login page wired to backend
- [ ] Song list page using mock or real data

## Next Steps (High-Level)
- Connect song list and detail pages to real backend endpoints.
- Implement favorites page and favorite/unfavorite actions.

- Improve loading and error states for all main pages.
- Add minimal tests (component tests for key pages and hooks).
